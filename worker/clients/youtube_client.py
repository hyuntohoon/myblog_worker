"""YouTube Data API v3 — `videos.list` only.

FEAT-youtube-playback-provider Step A5.

TWIN NOTICE. This is the second of three YouTube clients in this system, and
they are deliberately NOT identical in surface:

  myblog_music/app/clients/youtube_client.py   search.list + videos.list  (A2)
  myblog_backend/app/clients/youtube_client.py videos.list ONLY           (A3)
  myblog_worker/worker/clients/youtube_client.py videos.list ONLY         (A5, this file)

`search.list` is DISCOVERY and costs 100 units against a shared daily pool; it
belongs in exactly one place, and that place is music. Backend and worker only
ever ask "what is the current state of these ids", which is `videos.list` at 1
unit for 50 ids. Giving this file a `search_videos` it does not need would put
the expensive call one autocomplete away from a route that must not make it.

What the three DO share is the error taxonomy and the credential handling, and
that shared part is the twin: **a fix to the quota/rate-limit split, to the
header-based auth, or to the malformed-payload hardening belongs in every copy
in the same change** (workspace CLAUDE.md, "Recurring bug classes" — a
pattern-shaped bug in duplicated cross-repo code gets swept, not patched once).

THE KEY GOES IN A HEADER, NEVER THE QUERY STRING. httpx logs `request.url` at
INFO on every completed request, so a `?key=` credential is one
`basicConfig(level=INFO)` away from CloudWatch. This is not hypothetical: the
A2 revision of the music client shipped that shape and a review caught it.

WHY THE WORKER NEEDS IT. YouTube Developer Policy III.E.4.c/.d caps stored API
data at 30 calendar days, with no exception for a resource id obtained from a
public `search.list`. The refresh job is what keeps mappings inside that window
— and what deletes the ones it could not refresh. `videos.list` takes 50 ids per
1-unit call, which is the whole reason the design is affordable: a fully mapped
catalog is ~21 units/day against a 10,000-unit pool.
