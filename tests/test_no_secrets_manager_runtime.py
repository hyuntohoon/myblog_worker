"""CHORE-secrets-ssm-migration lint: no Secrets Manager identifier in runtime code.

**What actually prevents Secrets Manager from being used** is not this file. It
is that the account holds zero secrets (`secretsmanager:ListSecrets` in
ap-northeast-2 returns `[]`, verified 2026-08-28) and that `infra/secrets.tf`
grants no `secretsmanager:*` action to any Lambda role. A reintroduced call
would fail on both counts.

This test is a **lint against the realistic accident** — someone reinstating the
deleted branch, or copying it out of git history into a new module — so the
mistake is caught in CI instead of at a cold start. It is deliberately not
claimed as a security control, because a text scan cannot be one: a client name
assembled at runtime defeats it and is meant to.

Caught: a literal `boto3.client("secretsmanager")`, `get_secret_value`,
`put_secret_value`, `SECRETS_ARN`, and implicit concatenation such as
`("secrets" "manager")`.
Not caught, by construction: `"secrets" + "manager"`, an f-string, a name read
from the environment, `getattr`/`importlib` indirection, or a call made from
inside a dependency rather than this repository's own source.

Comments are stripped before scanning, on purpose: the history of why this path
is gone must stay readable in the source.
